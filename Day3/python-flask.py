Flask and Django:

Flask vs Django:
- Flask is a microframework that is simple and lightweight, suitable for small-scale applications and prototypes.
It provides flexibility and allows developers to choose the components they need.

- Django is a full-featured web framework designed for large-scale applications. 
It is a full-stack framework that includes everything needed to build web applications out of the box. 
Django follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a set of components for common web development tasks such as authentication, routing, and templating.

Steps for creating a Django Project:

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   mkdir djangoclass
   cd djangoclass

2. Create a virtual environment (venv) for your project:
   python -m venv venv

   This command creates a directory named 'venv' in your current working directory
   and sets up the necessary files and directories for a virtual environment.

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   On Windows, run:
   venv\Scripts\activate

   On macOS/Linux, run:
   source venv/bin/activate

   Activating the virtual environment isolates your project's Python environment,
   allowing you to install packages and manage dependencies without affecting your system Python installation.
